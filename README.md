 #### nicole 
This website tells you all about me and my portfolio work. My portfolio website uses Materialize, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and jQuery.

#### index.html
The head of the index file includes links to a favicon, reset css, materialize, style css, and a font awesome link. It also includes script files for jQuery, materialize, the carousel images, and the logic for javascript. The index file includes a nav bar header with links that run functions in my javascript file. The carousel image runs with the display.js file. The content body of the page is controlled with the script file. The footer features font awesome links to my social media and a link at the bottom to my github. The application is mobile responsive due to materialize. 

#### style.css
The style of this page is controlled through the style.css file. 

#### script.js
The script file runs four functions: home, about me, portfolio, and contact me. These functions run once the link in the nav bar is clicked.
